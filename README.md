## Basics
1. Priority: colors. Red: urgent, Yellow: important, Green: not important or urgent, Gray: done
2. When a task is done, gray it out and put a line in it
3. A textfield with dashed line will be visiable at the buttom of the all the tasks. The same goes for a subtask if there is a task.
4. Once a task is completed, subtask also will be completed.
5. If user wants to delete a tast, a warning will be displayed to ask if user is ok, all the subtasks will be deleted too.
6. If user wants to add a task, next to text field will be two icons. One for due date and other for priority. Both are optional.
7. A animation will be shown with a sound when a test is deleted or completed or added. These animations will be different from each other. Delete, tasks will move to right and disappear, Adding: tasks will appear and make a sound, complete: a line will go through the test.

### Tasks to create the website
1. Core Tasks
   - [x] Create a website using HTML and Bootstrap (use the starter template and include the responsive meta-tag to make your site responsive on mobile devices). (2 pts)
   - [x] Add a list of tasks and use CSS to format the list so that it is a well-designed to do list. Be thoughtful and intentional about your design. (2 pts)
   - [x] Allow the user to add items to the to do list. (This will require additional HTML elements as well as JavaScript.) (2 pts)
   - [x] Allow the user to check items off their list after the tasks have been completed. (2 pts)
   - [x] Allow the user to delete tasks from the list. (Note that this is not the same as completing tasks; the user may decide that it was an error to have included the tasks in the first place.) (2 pts)
2. Make it better
   - [x] Allow users to associate a due date with a task and display the due dates next to the tasks. (Use <input type="date"> for the date input.) (2 pts)
   - [x] Allow users to uncheck items that were accidentally checked. (1 pts)
3. Even Better
   - [x] Allow users to color code tasks to indicate priority or type of task. (2 pts)
   - [ ] Give some sort of feedback when users complete a task â€“ visual or sound or both. (See Google Tasks for an example.) Again, be thoughtful and deliberate about your design. (1 pt)
4. Cherry on Top
   - [ ] Allow users to define subtasks. Subtasks should be able to be checked off/deleted individually OR checked off /deleted together with the super-task. (1 pt)
